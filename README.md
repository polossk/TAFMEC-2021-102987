* Theoretical and Applied Fracture Mechanics
> This study presents a peridynamic model with an improved energy-based surface correction to simulate fractures of random porous materials. There exists a surface effect due to incomplete neighborhoods of boundary or near-boundary points in peridynamics. A surface correction approach is proposed to correct the surface effect on or near the boundaries, including outer boundaries of the materials and boundaries of inner pores. The correction factor is obtained based on the equivalence between the strain energy density in classical continuum mechanics and the elastic energy density in peridynamics. The algorithm procedure for the corrected model based on the finite element analysis is brought forward in detail. The availability of the proposed corrected peridynamic model is verified by comparing the results against the results by the classical continuum mechanics model. Moreover, the effect of the surface correction on the crack growth path and the impact of random distributions of pores on the fractures of porous materials are also investigated. Numerical results demonstrate that the present method can effectively correct the surface effect of random porous materials, especially around the boundary of inner pores, where shows a more obvious surface effect.
* 应对随机多孔材料断裂模拟的基于能量的边界修正方法的近场动力学模型
> 本文改进了近场动力学模型中基于能量的边界修正方法，并应用于随机多孔材料的断裂模拟。在近场动力学中，在边界上或邻近边界的物质点的近场作用邻域是不完整的，即边界效应（也称为表面效应）。本文提出了一种边界修正方法来校正边界效应，包括材料的外边界和内孔的边界。其中，边界修正因子是基于经典连续介质力学中的应变能密度与近场动力学中的弹性能密度这两者的等价性而获得的。同时本文详细列出了基于有限元方法的具体数值实现算法流程。通过将修正后结果与经典连续介质力学模型的结果进行比较，作者们验证了该模型有效性。此外，本文还讨论了边界修正对裂纹扩展路径的影响以及孔洞的随机分布对多孔材料断裂的影响。数值结果表明，该方法可以有效地校正随机多孔材料的边界效应，尤其是内孔边界部分。
